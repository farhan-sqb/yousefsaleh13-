        <p><b>Before you start:</b> please find a safe place to park the vehicle. It’s better to drive further and risk damaging the wheel rim than stop somewhere dangerous – such as on a narrow road. Leave your hazard lights on when you park. It's advisable to read your car's manual for advice first.</p>
        <p><b>1. Prepare the car:</b> Apply the handbrake and remove all passengers from the car. Take the spare wheel and necessary tools out of the boot.</p>
        <p><b>2. Position the wheel chocks:</b> Chocks prevent the car from rolling while jacked up. Position a chock on the opposite wheel to the one with a puncture. For example, if your left-front tyre has a puncture, put a chock behind the right-rear wheel. If your left-rear tyre is flat, you need a chock in front of the right-front. Use chocks for both front/rear wheels (as appropriate) if you have them. Bricks or large rocks can do the same job if you don’t have a dedicated chock.</p>
        <p><b>3. Loosen the wheel nuts:</b> It’s easier – and safer – to do this while the car is on the ground. You may need to lever off a plastic wheel trim first. Turn the wheel wrench anti-clockwise and loosen the nuts to the point where they can be turned by hand (be warned – they may be tough to loosen). However, don’t remove them completely yet.</p>
        <p><b>4. Jack the car up:</b> All cars have dedicated jacking points – consult your handbook to see where these are. Aim to position the jack at the side of the car, close to the punctured wheel. Placing a small plank of wood under the jack will help keep it stable. Raise the car slowly until the flat tyre is 10-15cm off the ground.</p>
        <p><b>5. Remove the flat tyre:</b> Fully loosen and remove the wheel nuts, then gently pull the tyre towards you until it comes free. Place it flat on the ground.</p>
        <p><b>6. Mount the spare wheel:</b> Slide the spare wheel onto the protruding hub bolts, or in line with the wheel nut slots (warning: it’s heavy to lift it off the ground to do this). Replace the wheel nuts and tighten them by hand.</p>
        <p><b>7. Lower the car and tighten the bolts:</b> Use the jack to drop the car down slightly, so that the spare tyre is in contact with the ground. Now use the wrench to fully tighten the wheel nuts.</p>
        <p><b>8. Fully lower the car:</b> Bring the car fully down to earth and remove the jack. Consider giving the wheel nuts a final check for tightness. Stow the jack and the other tyre in the boot, along with the rest of your equipment. Note: if your car has a space saver, the old wheel will take up more space in the boot.</p>
        <p><b>9. Check the spare tyre pressure:</b> If you have one, use a tyre pressure gauge to check the spare wheel is fully inflated. Alternatively, drive carefully to a petrol station and use the gauge there. Pump up the tyre to the recommended pressure – as detailed in the handbook – if necessary.</p>
